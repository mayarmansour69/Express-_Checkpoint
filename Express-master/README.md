# Express Checkpoint Report

---

## Project Overview

For this checkpoint project, I created a web application using Express.js and React.js. The goal was to build a web application with three main pages: Home, Our Services, and Contact us. Each page contains a navbar with links to the other pages. Additionally, the web application should only be available during working hours (Monday to Friday, from 9 AM to 5 PM).

## Implementation Details

### Backend (Express.js)

- Utilized Express.js to create a server and handle routes.
- Implemented custom middleware to verify the time of the request. This middleware restricts access to the web application outside of working hours.

### Frontend (React.js)

- Developed the frontend using React.js.
- Created three main components for the Home, Services, and Contact pages.
- Implemented React Router to handle navigation between pages.
- Integrated a Navbar component that appears on top of each page and contains links to the Home, Services, and Contact pages.

### Styling

- Styled the web application using CSS to achieve a modern, professional, and dark futuristic look.
- Applied CSS styles to the Navbar component to ensure it matches the overall design of the application.
